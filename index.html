            I’m a web developer specializing in front-end engineering. I create visually appealing and user-friendly
            interfaces that bring ideas to life on the web, with a focus on crafting seamless and intuitive experiences.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="leading-relaxed">
            Beyond coding, I’m a storyteller. I write stories, poems, and plays, and enjoy making games that blend
            traditional gameplay with modern technology. Whether I’m building a website or crafting a narrative, my goal
            is to create something meaningful and memorable.

              Hafcaf is an extremely minimal single-page application (SPA) framework, designed for people who want to
              rapidly create apps without having to learn a whole new way to create apps. If you know HTML, a little
              CSS, and a very little JavaScript, you can be creating a SPA in less than five minutes.

              <li>No build tools needed - but you can integrate with them if you wish</li>
              <li>Works as far back as IE 8</li>
              <li>Designed to require the use of as little JavaScript as possible</li>
              <li>Will play nice with pretty much all CSS frameworks</li>

          Eventually I will post information here about some of the games I've made, and probably also some of the games
          I enjoy playing.

          I'm obsessed with collecting Print and Play games in particular, and solo ones especially. If you know of a
          good one and/or want a recommendation, let me know!

        <p>Here's a short poem I wrote while trying to come up with content for this space:</p>

        <p>Roses are red,</p>
        <p>Coding is hard,</p>
        <p>Whatever you do,</p>
        <p>Don't trust a developer bard.</p>
        <br />
        <p>I'll post some more interesting content here at some point in the future. Probably.</p>

        <p>Info on how to contact me, should you for some reason desire to do so, will eventually go here.</p>
